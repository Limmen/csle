## Background

The development of CSLE started as a research project in 2020 at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, 
led by Prof. Rolf Stadler and Prof. Pontus Johnson. 
This research has been supported in part by the Swedish armed forces 
as well as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) 
through the CASTLE program under Contract No. w912cg23c0029. 
The research is conducted at the division of Network and Systems Engineering (NSE) 
and the KTH Center for Cyber Defense and Information Security (CDIS).  
The project is currently maintained by Kim Hammar (*kimham@kth.se*).
