# Capture the Flag - Version 001

This folder contains a set of virtual environments for the `ctf` mini-game of version 001. 
This is a security game for autonomous agents where the goal of the attacker is to collect information about the system
and identify services with vulnerabilities, whereas the goal of the defender is to find and patch the vulnerabilities
as soon as possible and to detect the attacker.

There are several versions and difficulty levels of the minigame. Specifically:

- *Level 1* [./level_1](level_1): A simple infrastructure with 6 nodes and weak-password-vulnerabilities
- *Level 2* [./level_2](level_2): An infrastructure with 12 nodes and weak-password-vulnerabilities
- *Level 3* [./level_3](level_3): A complex infrastructure with 33 nodes and weak-password-vulnerabilities
- *Level 4* [./level_4](level_4): A simple infrastructure with 6 nodes and weak-password-vulnerabilities and IDS monitoring
- *Level 5* [./level_5](level_5): An infrastructure with 12 nodes and weak-password-vulnerabilities and IDS monitoring
- *Level 6* [./level_6](level_6): A complex infrastructure with 33 nodes and weak-password-vulnerabilities and IDS monitoring
- *Level 7* [./level_7](level_7): An infrastructure with 15 nodes and several vulnerabilities: SambaCry, Shellshock, CVE-2015-1427, CVE-2015-3306, CVE-2016-100033_1,and SQL injection., as well as SSH, FTP, Telnet servers that can be compromised using dictionary attacks
- *Level 8* [./level_8](level_8): An infrastructure with 26 nodes and several vulnerabilities: SambaCry, Shellshock, CVE-2015-1427, CVE-2015-3306, CVE-2016-100033_1,and SQL injection., as well as SSH, FTP, Telnet servers that can be compromised using dictionary attacks
- *Level 9* [./level_9](level_9): A complex infrastructure with 36 nodes and and several vulnerabilities: SambaCry, Shellshock, CVE-2015-1427, CVE-2015-3306, CVE-2016-100033_1, SQL injection, and brute-force vulnerabilities. Further, the infrastructure has IDS monitoring
- *Level 10* [./level_10](level_10): An infrastructure with 16 nodes and several vulnerabilities: SambaCry, Shellshock, CVE-2015-1427, CVE-2015-3306, CVE-2016-100033_1,and SQL injection., Pengine Server RCE Exploit, as well as SSH, FTP, Telnet servers that can be compromised using dictionary attacks
- *Level 11* [./level_11](level_11): A complex infrastructure with 36 nodes and and several vulnerabilities: SambaCry, Shellshock, CVE-2015-1427, CVE-2015-3306, CVE-2016-100033_1, SQL injection, and brute-force vulnerabilities. Further, the infrastructure has IDS monitoring
- *Level 12* [./level_12](level_12): A simple software-defined networking environment
